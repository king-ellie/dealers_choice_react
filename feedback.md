Great job, Ellie! This is really nice work. All your data routes should be on a consistent path, so your post, put, get, and delete routes should be on a similar path. Your data routes should also be completely separate from the view of the webpage. Instead of redirecting from the post route, the proper way is to respond with the newly created item and add that new item to the state. I've made more comments about this in the `server.js` and `Main.js` files.
